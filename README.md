# Custom Shell
The shell provides a user interface that allows you to interact with the operating system by entering commands, which the system interprets and executes. In most operating systems, a shell (like Bash, Zsh, or the Windows Command Prompt) is the primary CLI used to run programs, manage files, and perform other system tasks.

Creating a CLI was an incredible learning experience that gave me a deep understanding of low-level processes, which has benefited every project I've worked on. Parsing command-line inputs, managing memory allocation, and navigating the path variable to provide users with command-line access for opening, editing, and manipulating files at a system level gave me strong fundamentals for handling core processes.

<br/>
A project to not only learn C on a deeper level but understand how things like a shell and its functions work fundamentally. Managing things like memory allocation, user error, and system exploration are what makes this project stand out.

Writing this project was a true test of my skills and challenged my ability to follow complex logic paths. I developed the entire program in the vi editor within a terminal environment, working without modern IDE conveniences. This setup pushed me to focus closely on syntax, efficient navigation, and clear logic, all of which were crucial in bringing the project together successfully.
